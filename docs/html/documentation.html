<p class="paragraph">--- ## Introduction ### 1.1. Overview of DFT Development The Droplet-Film Theory Development project represents a sophisticated approach to predicting liquid loading in gas wells through the integration of fundamental physics principles with advanced machine learning techniques. This comprehensive framework addresses one of the most critical challenges in petroleum engineering: determining when gas wells will experience liquid loading, a phenomenon that significantly impacts production efficiency and well performance. Liquid loading occurs when the gas velocity in a well drops below a critical threshold, causing liquid accumulation in the tubing or casing. This phenomenon leads to reduced gas production rates, increased pressure drop, potential well shutdown, and significant economic losses. The DFT Development project provides sophisticated models to predict critical flow rates, enabling operators to optimize well performance and prevent costly production interruptions. The project is built on Droplet-Film Theory, a fundamental framework that describes the complex multiphase flow behavior in gas wells. This theory accounts for droplet entrainment and transport mechanisms, film formation and stability criteria, gravity and buoyancy effects, friction and pressure drop relationships, and well deviation angle impacts. This physics-based approach ensures that predictions are not only accurate but also interpretable and grounded in established engineering principles. ### 1.2. What does a DFT Development version mean DFT Development uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) to indicate the nature of changes between releases. The MAJOR version number indicates incompatible API changes that may require code modifications when upgrading. The MINOR version number indicates new functionality that has been added in a backwards compatible manner, allowing existing code to continue working while providing access to new features. The PATCH version number indicates backwards compatible bug fixes that improve stability and performance without changing the API. The current version is 2.0.0, representing a major release that includes significant improvements to the physics model implementation, enhanced machine learning integration, and expanded support for multiple modeling approaches including PySINDY, PySR, XGBoost, and QLattice. ### 1.3.

Python environment setup Setting up a proper Python environment is crucial for the successful installation and operation of the DFT Development framework. We strongly recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects and to ensure reproducible installations across different systems. The first step is to install Python from the official website at python.org. Choose Python 3.9 or 3.10 for the best compatibility with the framework and its dependencies. During installation, ensure that "Add Python to PATH" is checked, which allows you to run Python from the command line. After installation, verify that Python is working correctly by opening a terminal and running the command `python --version`. Creating a virtual environment provides isolation for the DFT Development project and its dependencies. On Windows, create a virtual environment using the commands `python -m venv dft_env` followed by `dft_env\Scripts\activate`. On macOS and Linux, use `python3 -m venv dft_env` followed by `source dft_env/bin/activate`. The virtual environment should be activated whenever you work with the DFT Development framework. After creating and activating the virtual environment, upgrade pip to ensure you have the latest version. Run `python -m pip install --upgrade pip` to update pip to the latest version. This step is important because some packages may require the latest pip features for proper installation. ### 2.3. Package installation methods The DFT Development framework can be installed using several methods, each offering different advantages depending on your needs and preferences. The complete installation method is recommended for most users as it installs all dependencies and the project in development mode, enabling easy updates and modifications. The complete installation method involves cloning the repository from GitHub and installing the project in development mode. First, clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Droplet-Film-Theory-Development.git`, then navigate to the project directory with `cd Droplet-Film-Theory-Development`. Finally, install the project and all dependencies using `pip install -e .`. This method ensures that all dependencies are installed with compatible versions and that the project is properly configured. The manual installation method provides more control over the installation process by allowing you to install packages individually. This method is useful when you need to customize the installation or when you encounter issues with the complete installation. Install the core dependencies first using `pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn`, then add visualization packages with `pip install matplotlib seaborn jupyter`, and finally install specialized machine learning libraries with `pip install feyn pysindy xgboost`. The requirements file method provides a middle ground between complete and manual installation. If a requirements.txt file exists in the project directory, you can install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This method ensures that all packages are installed with the exact versions that were tested and verified by the development team. ### 2.4. Verification and testing After installation, it is important to verify that the DFT Development framework is working correctly. This verification process includes testing basic imports, checking project-specific functionality, and running a simple example to ensure everything is properly configured. Test the basic Python packages by running commands such as `python -c "import numpy; print('NumPy version:', numpy.__version__)"` for NumPy, `python -c "import pandas; print('Pandas version:', pandas.__version__)"` for Pandas, and similar commands for SciPy and Scikit-learn. These commands verify that the core dependencies are installed and accessible. Test the project-specific modules by running `python -c "from scripts_2.0.dft_model import DFT; print('DFT import successful')"` for the DFT class, `python -c "from scripts_2.0.utils import ChiefBldr; print('ChiefBldr import successful')"` for the ChiefBldr class, and `python -c "from scripts_2.0.utils import QLatticeWrapper; print('QLatticeWrapper import successful')"` for the QLatticeWrapper class. These commands verify that the project modules can be imported without errors. Test the basic functionality by running a simple example that creates sample data, initializes a model, trains it, and makes predictions. This test verifies that the entire pipeline is working correctly and that there are no runtime errors or configuration issues. ### 2.5. Jupyter notebook setup Jupyter notebooks provide an excellent environment for interactive development and analysis with the DFT Development framework. The notebook interface allows you to combine code, documentation, and visualizations in a single document, making it ideal for exploratory analysis and sharing results with colleagues. Install Jupyter and related packages using `pip install jupyter notebook ipywidgets`. The Jupyter package provides the core notebook functionality, while the notebook package includes additional features for notebook management. The ipywidgets package enables interactive widgets that can enhance the notebook experience. Launch Jupyter by running `jupyter notebook` in your terminal. This command starts the Jupyter server and opens your web browser to the notebook interface. Navigate to the scripts_2.0 directory to access the example notebooks that demonstrate various aspects of the DFT Development framework. The framework includes several example notebooks that showcase different modeling approaches and use cases. The DFT-PISR.ipynb notebook demonstrates the main physics-informed implementation, while xgboost.ipynb shows the gradient boosting approach. The sindy.ipynb notebook illustrates symbolic regression analysis, and QLattice.ipynb demonstrates automated model discovery. ### 2.6. Data preparation Preparing your data correctly is essential for successful use of the DFT Development framework. The framework requires data in a specific format with particular column names and data types. Understanding these requirements and properly preparing your data will ensure optimal performance and accurate results. The framework requires data to be in CSV format with exactly ten columns representing different physical parameters of the gas well system. The first column, Dia, represents the well diameter in meters and should contain positive floating-point values. The second column, Dev(deg), represents the well deviation angle in degrees and should contain values between 0 and 90 degrees. The third column, Area (m2), represents the cross-sectional area in square meters and should be calculated based on the well diameter. The fourth column, z, represents the elevation change in meters and should contain positive values. The fifth column, GasDens, represents the gas density in kg/m³ and should contain positive values typically between 0.5 and 2.0 kg/m³. The remaining columns follow similar patterns with specific units and value ranges. LiquidDens represents liquid density in kg/m³, g (m/s2) represents gravitational acceleration in m/s², P/T represents the pressure-to-temperature ratio in Pa/K, friction_factor represents the dimensionless friction factor, and critical_film_thickness represents the critical film thickness in meters. ### 2.7. Common installation issues Installation issues can arise due to various factors including system configuration, package conflicts, and network connectivity. Understanding common issues and their solutions will help you resolve problems quickly and get the framework running smoothly. Permission errors often occur when trying to install packages system-wide or when the user account lacks sufficient privileges. The solution is to use the --user flag with pip install commands, which installs packages in the user's home directory rather than system-wide. Alternatively, using a virtual environment eliminates permission issues by keeping all packages isolated within the project directory. Version conflicts can occur when different packages require incompatible versions of the same dependency. The solution is to create a fresh virtual environment and install packages one by one, testing after each installation to identify the problematic package. Using the complete installation method often resolves version conflicts by installing all packages with compatible versions. Memory issues can occur during installation when the system runs out of available memory. The solution is to close other applications to free up memory, restart the computer if necessary, and use the --no-cache-dir flag with pip install commands to reduce memory usage during installation. Network issues can prevent package downloads due to firewall restrictions, proxy settings, or connectivity problems. The solution is to use alternative package sources such as PyPI mirrors, configure proxy settings if necessary, and ensure that the system has proper internet connectivity. ### 2.8. Development environment setup Setting up a proper development environment is essential for contributors and advanced users who want to modify or extend the DFT Development framework. The development environment includes code quality tools, testing frameworks, and IDE configuration that support professional software development practices. Install code quality tools using `pip install black flake8 pytest mypy`. The black package provides automatic code formatting according to Python style guidelines, while flake8 performs linting to identify potential issues and style violations. The pytest package provides a comprehensive testing framework, and mypy performs static type checking to identify type-related errors. Configure code formatting by running `black scripts_2.0/*.py` to format all Python files in the project. Configure linting by running `flake8 scripts_2.0/*.py` to check for style violations and potential issues. Configure type checking by running `mypy scripts_2.0/*.py` to identify type-related errors and inconsistencies. For IDE configuration, Visual Studio Code users should install the Python extension and configure the project interpreter to use the virtual environment. PyCharm users should configure the project interpreter and enable code inspection features. Both IDEs provide excellent support for Python development with features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging capabilities. --- ## Quick Start ### 3.1. Basic workflow The basic workflow for using the DFT Development framework involves five main steps that guide you from data preparation to making predictions. This workflow is designed to be straightforward and accessible to users with varying levels of experience in machine learning and petroleum engineering. The first step is to load your data using the ChiefBldr class, which handles data loading, validation, and preprocessing. The ChiefBldr class automatically splits your data into training and test sets, validates the required columns and data types, and prepares the data for model training. This step ensures that your data is in the correct format and ready for analysis. The second step is to initialize the model you want to use. The framework provides several modeling approaches including the DFT physics model, QLattice symbolic regression, XGBoost gradient boosting, and PySINDy equation discovery. Choose the model that best fits your needs and data characteristics. The third step is to train the model using your prepared data. The training process involves optimizing model parameters to minimize prediction errors on the training data. The framework provides automatic hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation to ensure robust model performance. The fourth step is to make predictions on new data using the trained model. The prediction process uses the optimized parameters to estimate critical flow rates for new well conditions. The framework provides confidence intervals and uncertainty estimates to help assess prediction reliability. The fifth step is to analyze the results and evaluate model performance. The framework provides comprehensive performance metrics, visualization tools, and analysis capabilities to help you understand the model's behavior and validate its predictions. ### 3.2. Your first prediction Creating your first prediction with the DFT Development framework is straightforward and requires only a few lines of code. This example demonstrates the complete process from data loading to making predictions, providing a foundation for more complex analyses. Begin by importing the necessary modules from the framework. The DFT class provides the core physics model, while the ChiefBldr class handles data management and preprocessing. These classes work together to provide a complete solution for predicting critical flow rates in gas wells. Load your data using the ChiefBldr class, specifying the path to your CSV file and the desired test set size. The ChiefBldr class automatically validates your data, ensures all required columns are present, and splits the data into training and test sets. This process handles common data issues and prepares your data for model training. Create and train a DFT model using the prepared data. The DFT model implements the Droplet-Film Theory equations and provides physics-informed predictions of critical flow rates. The model automatically optimizes its parameters to minimize prediction errors while maintaining physical interpretability. Make predictions on the test data to evaluate model performance. The prediction process uses the optimized parameters to estimate critical flow rates for the test wells. The framework provides both point predictions and uncertainty estimates to help assess prediction reliability. ### 3.3. Understanding the output The output from the DFT Development framework includes several components that provide comprehensive information about the model's predictions and performance. Understanding these components is essential for interpreting results and making informed decisions based on the model's output. The primary output is the predicted critical flow rates, which represent the minimum gas flow rate required to prevent liquid loading in each well. These predictions are based on the physics-informed model and provide estimates of the critical conditions for each well in your dataset.

Required input parameters The DFT Development framework requires input data in a specific format with exactly ten columns representing different physical parameters of the gas well system. Each parameter has specific units, value ranges, and physical significance that are essential for accurate model predictions. The well diameter (Dia) is measured in meters and represents the internal diameter of the production tubing or casing. This parameter directly affects the flow area and influences both droplet and film behavior. Typical values range from 0.05 to 0.3 meters for most gas wells, with larger diameters generally requiring higher critical flow rates. The well deviation angle (Dev(deg)) is measured in degrees from vertical and represents the angle at which the well deviates from the vertical direction. This parameter is crucial for understanding the effects of gravity on liquid droplet behavior and film formation. Values range from 0 degrees (vertical) to 90 degrees (horizontal), with different flow regimes occurring at different angles. The cross-sectional area (Area (m2)) is calculated from the well diameter and represents the available flow area for gas and liquid. This parameter is used in the physics equations to determine flow velocities and pressure drops. The area is typically calculated as π × (diameter/2)² for circular cross-sections. The elevation change (z) is measured in meters and represents the vertical distance over which the flow occurs. This parameter accounts for gravitational effects on the flow and is particularly important for wells with significant vertical components. Positive values indicate upward flow, while negative values indicate downward flow. The gas density (GasDens) is measured in kg/m³ and represents the density of the gas phase at the operating conditions. This parameter varies with pressure, temperature, and gas composition. Typical values range from 0.5 to 2.0 kg/m³ for natural gas at standard conditions. The liquid density (LiquidDens) is measured in kg/m³ and represents the density of the liquid phase, typically water or condensate. This parameter is relatively constant for most applications, typically around 1000 kg/m³ for water. The density difference between liquid and gas phases drives the gravitational separation effects. The gravitational acceleration (g (m/s2)) is measured in m/s² and represents the local gravitational acceleration. This parameter is typically 9.81 m/s² for most locations on Earth but may vary slightly with latitude and altitude. The gravitational acceleration affects both droplet settling and film flow behavior. The pressure-to-temperature ratio (P/T) is measured in Pa/K and represents the ratio of operating pressure to operating temperature. This parameter affects gas density and viscosity, which in turn influence flow behavior. The ratio is typically calculated from the absolute pressure and absolute temperature at the operating conditions. The friction factor (friction_factor) is dimensionless and represents the resistance to flow due to wall friction. This parameter depends on the pipe roughness, Reynolds number, and flow regime. Typical values range from 0.01 to 0.05 for most gas wells, with higher values indicating more resistance to flow. The critical film thickness (critical_film_thickness) is measured in meters and represents the minimum film thickness required for stable film flow. This parameter is crucial for determining the transition between droplet and film flow regimes. Typical values range from 0.0001 to 0.01 meters, depending on the specific flow conditions. ### 4.2. Data validation Data validation is a critical step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the DFT Development framework. The framework includes comprehensive validation procedures that check data format, completeness, and consistency before processing. Understanding these validation procedures helps ensure that your data is properly prepared and that potential issues are identified early. The framework automatically validates that all required columns are present in your dataset. Missing columns are identified and reported, allowing you to add them or correct column names before processing. The validation process is case-sensitive and requires exact matches for column names. Data type validation ensures that each column contains the expected data types. Numeric columns must contain numeric values, and the framework will attempt to convert string values to numbers where possible. Invalid data types are reported with specific error messages that help identify and correct the issues. Range validation checks that parameter values fall within physically reasonable ranges. Values outside these ranges may indicate data entry errors or unusual conditions that require special attention. The framework provides warnings for values that are outside typical ranges but still physically possible. Consistency validation checks for logical relationships between parameters. For example, the cross-sectional area should be consistent with the well diameter, and the pressure-to-temperature ratio should be reasonable for the operating conditions. These checks help identify potential data entry errors or measurement issues. The framework also checks for missing values, infinite values, and other data quality issues that could affect model performance. Missing values are identified and can be handled through various strategies including removal, interpolation, or imputation. Infinite values are flagged as they can cause numerical issues during model training. ### 4.3. Data preprocessing Data preprocessing is an essential step in preparing your data for analysis with the DFT Development framework. The framework provides automatic preprocessing capabilities that handle common data issues and prepare your data for optimal model performance. Understanding these preprocessing steps helps ensure that your data is properly prepared and that the model can achieve its best performance. The framework automatically handles missing values through various strategies depending on the specific situation. For small numbers of missing values, the framework can interpolate or impute values based on statistical methods. For larger numbers of missing values, the framework may recommend removing problematic rows or using more sophisticated imputation methods. Data type conversion ensures that all parameters are in the correct format for analysis. The framework automatically converts string values to numeric values where possible, and provides clear error messages when conversion is not possible. This process handles common data format issues such as comma-separated numbers or scientific notation. Scaling and normalization can be applied to improve model performance and numerical stability. The framework provides options for standard scaling, min-max scaling, and other normalization methods. These preprocessing steps are particularly important when using machine learning approaches that are sensitive to the scale of input features. Outlier detection and handling help identify and address unusual data points that may affect model performance. The framework provides statistical methods for outlier detection and various strategies for handling outliers including removal, transformation, or special treatment during model training. Feature engineering capabilities allow you to create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance. The framework provides functions for common transformations such as logarithmic scaling, polynomial features, and interaction terms. These capabilities help you extract the maximum information from your data. ### 4.4. Common data issues Several common data issues can affect the performance of the DFT Development framework and should be addressed before analysis. Understanding these issues and their solutions helps ensure that your data is properly prepared and that the model can achieve its best performance. Missing values are one of the most common data issues and can occur due to various reasons including measurement failures, data entry errors, or incomplete records. The framework provides several strategies for handling missing values including removal of incomplete records, interpolation based on statistical methods, or imputation using machine learning techniques. Data type mismatches occur when numeric data is stored as text or when different numeric formats are mixed in the same column. The framework automatically attempts to convert data to the correct types, but manual correction may be necessary for complex cases. Common issues include comma-separated numbers, scientific notation, and mixed formats. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the majority of the data and can affect model performance. The framework provides statistical methods for outlier detection and various strategies for handling outliers. Some outliers may represent genuine unusual conditions that are important for the analysis, while others may be data entry errors that should be corrected. Inconsistent units can cause significant problems in physics-based models where unit consistency is crucial. The framework expects specific units for each parameter and will provide warnings if units appear to be inconsistent. Common issues include mixing metric and imperial units, or using different reference conditions for pressure and temperature. Data leakage occurs when information from the future or test set inadvertently influences the training process. This can lead to overly optimistic performance estimates and poor generalization to new data. The framework includes checks for common data leakage scenarios and provides guidance on proper data splitting and preprocessing procedures. --- ## Running DFT Development ### 5.1.
